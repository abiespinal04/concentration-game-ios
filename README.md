## Concentration Game for iOS

######  The Concentration Game, built with SwiftUI, is a memory matching game. Players flip cards to find matching pairs, aiming to remember the positions of the cards they have seen. The game features a grid layout, with each card displaying a different emoji when flipped. The objective is to match all pairs of cards with the fewest possible moves, enhancing memory and concentration skills. The project leverages SwiftUI's declarative syntax for creating a clean and simple interface. The design pattern employed is Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM), which separates the user interface (View) from the business logic (Model), with the ViewModel acting as an intermediary.
